My GitHub repository contains a player choice narrative featuring the privateer Sir John Hawkins among other characters. The goal of my narrative game was to introduce players to the world of Elizabethan England through Queen Elizabeth's trade network. Set in the 1500s the player can see how intertwined England is with neighboring countries such as Spain and France. Also, even with the focus of the narrative being England, the player can experience an interaction with a west African slave trading empire. Lastly, I wanted to convey how dangerous it would have been for a privateer in-training to set out on a journey away from home in the 1500s. There could have been endless scenarios for how the game could have ended. Even though it began to branch was from the focus of the course, I was curious to see, if the player survived, would they choose to leave home and make a new life in a foreign country?
